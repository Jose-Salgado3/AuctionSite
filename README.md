# AuctionSite

## About
We have created an auction website that will provide users the ability to post personal items or belongings for sale. Other members of thw
websites community will be able to browse or search these items. The items can be placed for a flat sale price as well as placed for 
auction pricing. Users will be able to post and delete items. The first release will be a basic version that will be built upon later 
and implement more enhanced features that you can find listed in our repository.
