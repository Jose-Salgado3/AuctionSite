<h1>Products!</h1>
<p>
    This will be the beginning of the products page that will show all of the current offers with pagination implemented eventually
    I will go ahead and get add and delete working for now and move to displaying items after the DB is populated.

<div class="grid-container">
    <ul>
        @foreach (Product p in Model)
        {
            
            //Will also look to display image here and move to a gallery style layout
            <b>@Html.DisplayTextFor(m => p.Name)</b>

            <li>
                @Html.DisplayTextFor(m => p.Price)
            </li>

            @Html.DisplayTextFor(m => p.Image)

        }      
    </ul>
    <br />
</div>
